You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

I've been working with web dev for 2 years now :P
Creating the html after a mockup is the easiest part probably, while,
grasping all the concepts related to javascript and how it relates
to the DOM has been the most difficult.

Regarding the first project I can't really say because this was added
after I finished that course and I did it months ago :P
